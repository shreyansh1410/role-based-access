<p id="description">This project is a modern responsive web application built with React that implements role-based access control (RBAC). It's designed to showcase different levels of access and content based on user roles providing a practical example of how to structure and secure a multi-user web application.</p>

<h2> Key Features </h2>

1. **User Authentication**: A login system that manages user access to the application.
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different pages and features are accessible based on user roles (guest, user, admin).
3. **Protected Routes**: Utilizes React Router with a custom ProtectedRoute component to secure access to role-specific pages.
4. **Modern UI**: Incorporates a sleek, responsive design with ShadCN components and custom layouts, optimizing user experience across all devices.
5. **Dark Mode**: Includes a toggleable dark mode feature that adapts to user preferences, enhancing accessibility and providing an optimal viewing experience in low-light environments.
6. **State Management with Redux**:  Centralizes application state using Redux for managing user authentication, role data, and theme preferences, ensuring smooth state transitions across components.

<h2> Technical Stack </h2>

- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **Routing**: React Router
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite

<h2> Project Structure </h2>

The application is structured with separate components for each page type (Admin, User, Guest, Login, Unauthorized) and uses a shared Layout component for consistent styling. The main App component sets up the routing logic, including protected routes for role-specific access.

<h2> Use Cases </h2>

This project serves as an excellent starting point or reference for:

- Developers learning to implement role-based access control in React applications
- Teams looking to set up a secure, multi-user web application
- Educational purposes to demonstrate React routing and component-based architecture

<h2> Future Potential </h2>

While currently focused on demonstrating RBAC concepts, this project has the potential to be expanded into a full-fledged application by adding:

- Backend integration for real authentication and user management
- More complex role hierarchies and permissions
- Additional features and interactivity within each role-specific dashboard
